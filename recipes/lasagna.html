    <p> Homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, fresh tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but this recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>
